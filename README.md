PLSM2013-bootstrap
==================

## Introduction
This is the source code of Veck Hsiao's self-instroduction page.

Initially, there are three files in this repository :

1. index.htm - the main page of self-introduction.
2. more_css.css - this is the extra css file that I add into.
3. bootstrap - the folder contains twitter bootstrap framework source code.


## Usage
To make this file work, please prepare an HTTP server such as apache, ngix, IIS... etc.
Then downlaod the above three files and put them into the web service folder.

The HTTP server I develop on is apache, so I put these file into the folder "Appserv\www".
